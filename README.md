# NPSP-Videography

Welcome to the NPSP Videography repository! 

Here we will be tracking the work of the Power of Us Community Project, which creates short, digestible NPSP How-To videos from NPSP documentation. This project is community led with the help, support, and encouragement of our allies at Salesforce.org. Watch this space for ways you can help!

Volunteer and join the discussion on the [Power of Us Hub group](https://powerofus.force.com/s/feed/0D51E00005GfhR2SAJ)
